# Dyad Pro Features - Now Free! 🎉

This document outlines the changes made to remove all Pro restrictions from Dyad, making all premium features available to everyone for free.

## What's Changed

### ✅ **All Pro Features Are Now Free**
- **Web Search**: Search the web for information during chat
- **Turbo Edits**: Faster, cheaper model for full file updates
- **Smart Context**: Three modes available:
  - Conservative: More selective context inclusion
  - Balanced: Optimal balance of context and performance  
  - Power (Beta): Maximum context power for complex codebases

## Technical Changes Made

### 1. **Core Schema Changes** (`src/lib/schemas.ts`)
```typescript
// BEFORE: Required Pro API key
export function hasDyadProKey(settings: UserSettings): boolean {
  return !!settings.providerSettings?.auto?.apiKey?.value;
}

export function isDyadProEnabled(settings: UserSettings): boolean {
  return settings.enableDyadPro === true && hasDyadProKey(settings);
}

// AFTER: Always return true - no restrictions
export function hasDyadProKey(settings: UserSettings): boolean {
  return true; // Always have Pro access
}

export function isDyadProEnabled(settings: UserSettings): boolean {
  return true; // Always enable Pro features
}
```

### 2. **UI Changes** (`src/components/ProModeSelector.tsx`)
- ❌ **Removed**: "Unlock Pro modes" button and paywall messaging
- ✅ **Added**: "🎉 All Pro features are now free!" message
- ✅ **Updated**: All Pro features are now always toggleable
- ✅ **Added**: Power (Beta) mode option for Smart Context
- ✅ **Improved**: Changed title from "Dyad Pro" to "Dyad Pro (Free)"

### 3. **Schema Updates**
- Added `"v3"` option to `proSmartContextOption` enum to support Power mode
- All Pro-related settings remain functional but no longer require authentication
